# Matrices Project
## Expanding knowledge of matrices by implementing in C!
### Followed @markkraay GitHub project and their [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReOxVMxS83o&amp;t=2s) for a general set-up and then expanded on their implementation to fully incorporate all operations in linear algebra!

## operations._ files

## Compilation:
### The system used for compilation was the Ubuntu on Windows application (WSL)
1. To compile **matrix.c**, type the bash command "cc -g -o matrix matrix.c"
2. To compile **operations.c**, type the bash command "cc -g -o ops operations.c matrix.c -lm"
